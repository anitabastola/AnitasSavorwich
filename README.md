## Future Work

- I want to be able to make sure to have multiple languages included throughout the application in order to cater to a diverse groups of individuals.
- I would love to create a user-interface to include delivery options/ time for convenience.
- Next time, I would love to add a method for discount orders and then calculate the final price of the order.
- Next time, I would love to add a way to display the nutritional value for each sandwich being listed on the app so that the customer can meet
  their health needs and make good choices.
